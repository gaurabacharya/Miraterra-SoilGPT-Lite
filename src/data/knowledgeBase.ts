    title: 'Understanding Soil pH',
    category: 'Soil Properties',
    content: 'Soil pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of soil on a scale from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Most plants thrive in soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. Soil pH affects nutrient availability - in highly acidic or alkaline soils, certain nutrients become locked up and unavailable to plants. Regularly testing soil pH is important for optimal plant growth and fertilizer efficiency.',

    title: 'The Role of Nitrogen in Plant Growth',
    category: 'Nutrients',
    content: 'Nitrogen (N) is essential for leaf and stem growth and is a key component of chlorophyll. Plants deficient in nitrogen show yellowing of older leaves (chlorosis) and stunted growth. Too much nitrogen can cause excessive vegetative growth at the expense of flowering and fruiting. Nitrogen is mobile in soil and can leach away in heavy rain, making it necessary to replenish regularly.',

    title: 'Phosphorus: Essential for Root Development',
    category: 'Nutrients',
    content: 'Phosphorus (P) plays a critical role in root development, flowering, fruiting, and seed production. It helps plants use and store energy from photosynthesis. Phosphorus deficiency causes stunted growth and purplish discoloration in leaves. Unlike nitrogen, phosphorus doesn\'t move much in soil and is less likely to leach away. Bone meal and rock phosphate are organic sources of phosphorus.',

    title: 'Potassium for Plant Health and Stress Resistance',
    category: 'Nutrients',
    content: 'Potassium (K) strengthens plants, helps them resist disease, improves drought tolerance, and enhances the quality of fruits and vegetables. Potassium deficiency appears as yellow or brown edges on older leaves. Wood ash, kelp meal, and greensand are good organic sources of potassium. Unlike nitrogen, potassium doesn\'t promote excessive growth but rather improves overall plant health.',

    title: 'Soil Moisture Management',
    category: 'Soil Properties',
    content: 'Proper soil moisture is critical for plant health. Too little water causes wilting and nutrient deficiencies, while too much leads to root rot and fungal diseases. Organic matter, like compost, improves both water retention in sandy soils and drainage in clay soils. Mulching helps conserve moisture by reducing evaporation. The ideal moisture content for most garden soils is between 20% and 60%.',

    title: 'Soil Amendments for Different Soil Types',
    category: 'Soil Management',
    content: 'Different soil types require different amendments. Sandy soils benefit from organic matter to improve water and nutrient retention. Clay soils need amendments like coarse sand, perlite, or compost to improve drainage and prevent compaction. Silt soils, while naturally fertile, can benefit from organic matter to improve structure. Regular addition of compost improves nearly all soil types.',

    title: 'Crop Rotation Benefits',
    category: 'Crop Management',
    content: 'Crop rotation involves changing the type of crops grown in a particular area each season or year. Benefits include reduced pest and disease problems, improved soil fertility, better weed control, and enhanced soil structure. A simple rotation might move from leaf crops to fruit crops to root crops to legumes. Different plant families take up different nutrients and attract different pests.',

    title: 'Understanding NPK Ratios in Fertilizers',
    category: 'Nutrients',
    content: 'NPK refers to the three main nutrients in fertilizers: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K). The numbers on fertilizer packaging (e.g., 10-10-10) represent the percentage of each nutrient by weight. Higher first number (N) promotes leaf growth, higher second number (P) supports roots and flowering, and higher third number (K) enhances overall health and stress resistance.',

    title: 'Soil Testing Methods and Frequency',
    category: 'Soil Management',
    content: 'Regular soil testing helps monitor nutrient levels and pH. Professional tests from extension offices or laboratories provide comprehensive results. Home test kits are less accurate but can give basic readings. For established gardens, testing every 2-3 years is usually sufficient. New gardens or troubleshooting situations may require more frequent testing. Fall is often the best time to test, allowing for amendments before spring planting.',

    title: 'Organic Matter: The Key to Healthy Soil',
    category: 'Soil Management',
    content: 'Organic matter improves soil structure, increases nutrient and water retention, promotes beneficial microbial activity, and helps maintain neutral pH. Sources include compost, manure, leaf mold, and cover crops. Aim for organic matter content of 5-10% for most garden soils. Regular additions are necessary as organic matter breaks down over time, especially in hot, humid climates.',

    title: 'Cover Crops for Soil Improvement',
    category: 'Soil Management',
    content: 'Cover crops, planted during off-seasons, protect and improve soil. Legumes like clover and vetch fix nitrogen from the air. Grasses like rye develop extensive root systems that prevent erosion and add organic matter. Buckwheat suppresses weeds and attracts beneficial insects. Cover crops can be turned into the soil as "green manure" or cut down to create mulch before planting the main crop.',

    content: 'Different crops thrive at different pH levels. Blueberries, potatoes, and strawberries prefer acidic soil (pH 4.5-6.0). Most vegetables grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil (pH 6.0-7.0), including tomatoes, peppers, and carrots. Brassicas like cabbage and broccoli tolerate slightly alkaline conditions (pH 6.5-7.5). Asparagus and beets can handle more alkaline soils (pH 6.5-8.0).',

    title: 'Signs of Nutrient Deficiencies in Plants',
    category: 'Plant Health',
    content: 'Yellowing of older leaves often indicates nitrogen deficiency. Purplish leaves may suggest phosphorus deficiency. Potassium deficiency appears as brown leaf edges. Iron deficiency causes yellowing between leaf veins on younger leaves. Calcium deficiency leads to blossom end rot in tomatoes and tip burn in cabbage. Many deficiencies can look similar, so soil testing is recommended for confirmation.',

    title: 'Soil Texture and Structure',
    category: 'Soil Properties',
    content: 'Soil texture refers to the proportion of sand, silt, and clay particles. Sandy soils drain quickly but hold few nutrients. Clay soils retain water and nutrients but may have drainage problems. Loam, a balanced mixture, is ideal for most plants. Soil structure describes how particles clump together, affecting root growth and water movement. Good structure includes stable aggregates with spaces for air and water.',

Practices include minimal tillage to protect soil structure, cover cropping to prevent erosion, crop rotation to break pest cycles, composting to recycle nutrients, and precision irrigation to conserve water. Building soil organic matter is central to almost all sustainable soil management systems.',
